# GOT_Character_Survival_Predictions

Supervised-Learning-Classification-Model-Development

Used information of the famous Game of Thrones books series to build a predictive model on a binary response variable (will the character be alive or not). The analysis includes feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, model development, and model hyperparameter tuning.

The classification models that were developed are:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
Classification Trees
Random Forest (Classification)
Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)
The final output of the Jupyter notebook is a table of the candidate models that shows the model type, training and testing accuracy, AUC score, confusion matrix, and the final model selection.
